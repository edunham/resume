resume
======

This is both my personal resume and an example of a Computer Science student's
technical resume. 

The LaTeX code is licensed under the MIT license, to prevent any ambiguity
about the fact that you are welcome to copy it and use it for whatever
purposes you like. The intended purpose is to make your own resume pretty
without having to think very much about LaTeX. 

See my advice at http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/resume/ for other technical
resume tips. 

To use my resume as a template for your own, either fork this repository (that
"fork" button in the upper right) or simply take a copy of the resume.tex
file. 

To generate and view the PDF, I run ``pdflatex resume.tex && evince
resume.pdf``. You can also use the included Makefile if you prefer.
